# TDF Data Platform - Executive Demo Script
## Duration: 15 Minutes | Vision Demo

---

## 🎯 Opening & Context Setting (2 minutes)

**Introduce Yourself:**
> "Hi, I'm [Name] from [Role]. Thank you for your time today."

**Set the Context (Critical - Read This):**

> "Before we dive in, let me set the right expectations for what you're about to see:
>
> **This is a vision demo** - we've created synthetic data that mirrors TDF's real business context. Think of this as **'what good looks like'** when your data strategy comes together.
>
> A few important points:
>
> 1. **Snowflake is not a BI tool** - we're not trying to replace Tableau or Power BI. What you'll see is what's possible when Snowflake becomes your **unified data foundation**.
>
> 2. **This is about data consolidation** - the magic happens when Commercial, HR, Operations, Finance, and ESG data all live in one governed platform. The dashboards are just the visualization layer.
>
> 3. **The value is in the integration** - today, you might have this data scattered across dozens of Excel files, legacy systems, and departmental silos. We're showing what happens when that friction disappears.
>
> So as you watch, don't think 'nice charts' - think: *'What decisions could I make faster if my data looked like this?'*"

**Introduce the Use Cases:**

> "Today we'll cover three critical business challenges that TDF identified as priorities:
>
> 1. **Adéquation Charge / Capacité** - replacing manual Excel capacity planning with real-time forecasting
> 2. **ESG Regulatory Reporting** - audit-ready reports with full data lineage for CSRD, Bilan GES, and Index Égalité
> 3. **CAPEX & Lifecycle Management** - predictive renewal models for equipment with 7-10 year lifecycles
>
> Each of these currently requires significant manual effort. Let's see what changes when the data flows automatically."

## 🎬 Closing (2 minutes)

**Say:**
> "Let me bring it back to what we discussed at the start.
>
> You've seen synthetic data - but the patterns, the pain points, the workflows are real. This is **what good looks like** when your data strategy comes together.
>
> **Three use cases, one platform:**
>
> 1. **Capacity Planning** - from 3-day Excel process to real-time, 18-month forecasting
> 2. **ESG Reporting** - from audit scramble to one-click traced reports
> 3. **CAPEX Management** - from budget guesswork to 7-year predictive models
>
> The common thread? **Cross-BU data consolidation.**
>
> Commercial + HR + Operations + Finance + Energy - when these stop being silos and start being one governed platform, this is what becomes possible.
>
> Remember: Snowflake isn't the dashboard. Snowflake is the **foundation** that makes dashboards like this trustworthy. The visualizations you saw could be in Tableau, Power BI, or Streamlit - what matters is that the underlying data is unified, governed, and audit-ready.
>
> **Questions?**"

## 📋 Backup Talking Points (if asked)

### "Is this real TDF data?"
> "This is synthetic data that mirrors TDF's business context - same structure, realistic patterns, but generated for demo purposes. The architecture and data model are production-ready."

### "How long would this take to implement?"
> "The platform can be stood up in weeks. The longer timeline is data integration - connecting your source systems and establishing governance. That's typically 3-6 months for a scope like this."

### "Can we customize the dashboards?"
> "Absolutely. These are Streamlit apps running in Snowflake - fully customizable. Or you can connect Tableau/Power BI to the same data layer. The value is in the unified data, not the specific visualization."

### "What about data security?"
> "Role-based access control at every level. Executives see everything, regional managers see their region. Full audit trail of who accessed what. This is enterprise-grade governance."

### "How accurate is the forecasting?"
> "The models are as accurate as your input data. With clean, consolidated data, we typically see 85-90% forecast accuracy at 6-month horizons. The platform also tracks forecast vs actual so you can continuously improve."

### "What's the ROI?"
> "Three areas: (1) Time savings - 3 days of Excel work eliminated per planning cycle, (2) Better decisions - real-time visibility vs monthly reports, (3) Audit readiness - hours not days to respond to auditor requests. Typical ROI is 3-4 FTE equivalent in the first year."

## 🎯 Key Messages to Reinforce Throughout

### What This Demo IS:
- ✅ A **vision** of "what good looks like"
- ✅ A demonstration of **cross-BU data consolidation**
- ✅ Proof that **audit-ready, real-time reporting** is achievable
- ✅ Synthetic data mirroring **real TDF business context**

### What This Demo IS NOT:
- ❌ A BI tool pitch (Snowflake ≠ Tableau)
- ❌ A promise of overnight implementation
- ❌ Just "pretty dashboards"

### The Value Equation:
```
Siloed Data + Manual Reconciliation = 3-day delays, audit stress, budget surprises

Unified Data + Snowflake Platform = Real-time visibility, one-click audits, predictive planning
```

## 💡 Pro Tips for the Demo

1. **Nail the opening** - The context-setting is critical. Don't skip it.
2. **Use the tabs** - Each page has organized tabs. Navigate smoothly, don't scroll endlessly.
3. **Pause on the "wow" moments** - Data lineage, 7-year forecast, AI recommendations
4. **Watch the room** - If they lean in on ESG, give it more time. Read the energy.
5. **Keep it conversational** - "What questions come up when you see this?" works better than lecturing.
6. **End with the question** - "What decisions could you make faster if your data looked like this?"
