## 🤖 6. Snowflake Intelligence Agent (3.5 minutes) ⭐ FINALE

**Navigate to:** Snowflake Intelligence (or show in Snowsight)

**Say:**
> "Now here's where it gets exciting. Everything we just saw - all four dashboards, all that data - you can now query with natural language using our AI assistant."

### Demo Flow:

**Question 1: Capacity Planning**
Type: *"What is our workforce capacity vs demand for the next 18 months?"*

- Wait for response
- *"It just queried the same data we saw in the capacity dashboard - but I didn't have to build a chart or know SQL"*

**Question 2: ESG Compliance**
Type: *"What is our Index Égalité score and are we compliant with French law?"*

- Wait for response
- *"Perfect for executives who need quick answers before a board meeting"*

**Question 3: Digital Twin**
Type: *"How many Digital Twin discrepancies are open and how many affect billing?"*

- Wait for response
- *"The AI knows how to join the right tables and filter correctly"*

**Question 4: CAPEX Lifecycle**
Type: *"What equipment is due for renewal in the next 3 years with the highest failure risk?"*

- Wait for response
- *"It combined lifecycle data with failure risk scores - a query that would take an analyst 30 minutes"*

### Talking Points:

> "This isn't ChatGPT with a database connection. It understands TDF's data model:
> - It knows our 18-month forecast horizon
> - It knows equipment lifecycles are 7-10 years
> - It knows Index Égalité threshold is 75
> - It has the full context of our business"

> "And because it's built on Snowflake, every query respects our data governance - role-based access, audit trails, the same security as the dashboards."

**Demo Highlight:**
- If time permits, ask a cross-domain question:
  *"Which regions have both capacity shortages AND high equipment failure risk?"*
- *"It's combining data from HR, Operations, and Infrastructure in one answer"*

## 🎬 Closing (30 seconds)

**Say:**
